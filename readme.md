## Bieblo Server

### Bieblo is the Back-office of Bieblo App (which can be found [here](https://github.com/oSoc15/biblo-app).)

Bieblo is a new intuitive and fun recommendation app for children. It can be tested at
[http://www.bieblo.be] (http://www.bieblo.be)

It currently runs on [Laravel 5.1](http://laravel.com).

### Documentation

First of all choose in which environment you are going to run Bieblo-server. We suggest running it in Homestead.
Visit [the official Laravel documentation] (http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/homestead) for more information.

Once everything is set up, run `composer install`.

Further in, run `npm install` and `bower install`. 
Run `gulp` once to initialize everything in terms of styling and functionality. If you are running Laravel in Homestead, don't run gulp in your virtual environment, but locally as well!
